# User Instructions
# 
# Modify the test() function to include three new test cases.
# These should assert that hand_rank gives the appropriate
# output for the given straight flush, four of a kind, and
# full house.
#
# For example, calling hand_rank on sf should output (8, 10)
#
# Since the program is still incomplete, clicking RUN won't do 
# anything, but clicking SUBMIT will let you know if you
# have gotten the problem right.
