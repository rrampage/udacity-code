# Modify the card_ranks() function so that cards with
# rank of ten, jack, queen, king, or ace (T, J, Q, K, A)
# are handled correctly. Do this by mapping 'T' to 10, 
# 'J' to 11, etc...

def card_ranks(cards):

    return ranks

print card_ranks(['AC', '3D', '4S', 'KH']) #should output [14, 13, 4, 3]
