# User Instructions
# 
# Write a function, bsuccessors(state), that takes a state as input
# and returns a dictionary of {state:action} pairs.
#
# A state is a (here, there, t) tuple, where here and there are 
# frozensets of people (indicated by their times), and potentially
# the 'light,' t is a number indicating the elapsed time.
#
# An action is a tuple (person1, person2, arrow), where arrow is 
# '->' for here to there or '<-' for there to here. When only one 
# person crosses, person2 will be the same as person one, so the
# action (2, 2, '->') means that the person with a travel time of
# 2 crossed from here to there alone.
