# User Instructions
# 
# This homework deals with anagrams. An anagram is a rearrangement 
# of the letters in a word to form one or more new words. 
#
# Your job is to write a function anagrams(), which takes as input 
# a phrase and an optional argument, shortest, which is an integer 
# that specifies the shortest acceptable word. Your function should
# return a set of all the possible combinations of anagrams. 
#
# Your function should not return every permutation of a multi word
# anagram: only the permutation where the words are in alphabetical
# order. For example, for the input string 'ANAGRAMS' the set that 
# your function returns should include 'AN ARM SAG', but should NOT 
# include 'ARM SAG AN', or 'SAG AN ARM', etc...

def anagrams(phrase, shortest=2):
    """Return a set of phrases with words from WORDS that form anagram
    of phrase. Spaces can be anywhere in phrase or anagram. All words 
    have length >= shortest. Phrases in answer must have words in 
    lexicographic order (not all permutations)."""
    # your code here
    
# ------------
# Helpful functions
# 
# You may find the following functions useful. These functions
# are identical to those we defined in lecture. 

def removed(letters, remove):
    "Return a str of letters, but with each letter in remove removed once."
    for L in remove:
        letters = letters.replace(L, '', 1)
    return letters

def find_words(letters):
    return extend_prefix('', letters, set())

def extend_prefix(pre, letters, results):
    if pre in WORDS: results.add(pre)
    if pre in PREFIXES:
        for L in letters:
            extend_prefix(pre+L, letters.replace(L, '', 1), results)
    return results

def prefixes(word):
    "A list of the initial sequences of a word, not including the complete word."
    return [word[:i] for i in range(len(word))]

def readwordlist(filename):
    "Return a pair of sets: all the words in a file, and all the prefixes. (Uppercased.)"
    wordset = set(open(filename).read().upper().split())
    prefixset = set(p for word in wordset for p in prefixes(word))
    return wordset, prefixset

WORDS, PREFIXES = readwordlist('words4k.txt')

# ------------
# Testing
# 
# Run the function test() to see if your function behaves as expected.
