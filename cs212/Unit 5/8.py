# In this problem, you will complete the code for the hold_at(x) 
# function. This function returns a strategy function (note that 
# hold_at is NOT the strategy function itself). The returned 
# strategy should hold if and only if pending >= x or if the 
# player has reached the goal.

    pending >= x or player reaches goal."""
