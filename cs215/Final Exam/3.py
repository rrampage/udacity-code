# In lecture, we took the bipartite Marvel graph,
# where edges went between characters and the comics
# books they appeared in, and created a weighted graph
# with edges between characters where the weight was the
# number of comic books in which they both appeared.
#
# In this assignment, determine the weights between
# comic book characters by giving the probability
# that a randomly chosen comic book containing one of
# the characters will also contain the other
#

from marvel import marvel, characters

def create_weighted_graph(bipartiteG, characters):
    G = {}
    # your code here
