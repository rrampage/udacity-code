# cs215 ; Problem Set 4 ; 2
#
# Given a list of numbers, L, find a number, x, that
# minimizes the sum of the absolute value of the difference
# between each element in L and x: SUM_{i=0}^{n-1} |L[i] - x|
# 
# Your code should run in Theta(n) time
#

def minimize_absolute(L):
    x = 0
    # your code here
    return x
