# Define a procedure, median, that takes three
# numbers as its inputs, and returns the median
# of the three numbers.

# Make sure your procedure has a return statement.

def bigger(a,b):
    if a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b

    return bigger(a,bigger(b,c))

#print(median(1,2,3))
#>>> 2

#print(median(9,3,6))
#>>> 6

#print(median(7,8,7))
#>>> 7
