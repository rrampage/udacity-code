# cs101 ; Problem Set 51 (Optional) ; 3
# Write a procedure, rotate which takes as its input a string of lower case
# letters, a-z, and spaces, and an integer n, and returns the string constructed
# by shifting each of the letters n steps, and leaving the spaces unchanged.
# Note that 'a' follows 'z'. You can use an additional procedure if you
# choose to as long as rotate returns the correct string.
# Note that n can be positive, negative or zero.

    # Your code here

print rotate ('sarah', 13)
#>>> 'fnenu'
print rotate('fnenu',13)
#>>> 'sarah'
print rotate('dave',5)
