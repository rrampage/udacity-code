# Write a function, mod_exp that returns
# `a**b % q` and has a runtime that is linear
# in the size of `b` - where the size of `b`
# is the number of bits

    # testing runtime performance in general is hard, but in this case
    # its enough to try large inputs.  For example on my machine naively
    # running 100 **  488778445455 % 543 takes a really long time
    # but mod_exp(100, 488778445455, 543) finishes pretty quick
    # Timings will be different on your machine if you are testing
    # locally, but in our environment, your routine should
    # be able to run through 1000 calculations in less then .5 seconds
